Question_2
Intended audience - The intended audience of this TV news channel is obviously the general public who's looking for the news. 
as I've taken this from the web, the article clearly explains what is is about. 

Question_3
1. Figure has no y-axis; 
2. The grid does not indicate any particular value, and bar height appears random and not in any correlation with stated values atop the bar. This graph either hides relevant data, or displays too much, i.e.: it should either use value labels and forego the y-axis and grid, or it should use the latter instead but remove values labels and properly label the axis instead.
3. Bar heights are an example ‘using graphic forms in inappropriate ways’, because they seem to distort the data, and they are for that reason simply not informative to the viewer. It is impossible to tell which values are represented based on the bars, which should be the purpose of a bar chart. The first thing to attract viewers’ attention in this graph is bar height. Based on this, it seems that the category “not at all” is the mode (answer that was given most), while in reality this answer was given least by respondents. Instead, “very” is the actual mode. So, this chart communicates the polar opposite of what the results really are.
